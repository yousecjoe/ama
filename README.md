# yousecjoe/ama

A repository to ask [@yousecjoe](https://twitter.com/Y0UNGSECURITY) anything.

I've worked in Infrastructure and Cybersecurity for nearly 30 years and have [written](http://youngsecurity.net/blog) and [spoken](http://youngsecurity.net/talks) about building infrastructure for high-performance computing and improving development workflow. If you have a question you're interested in asking, this is just the spot for you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/yousecjoe/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll answer it as soon as I can. Once I answer, I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions, respond in the thread, and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
question any old issue, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/yousecjoe/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### X

If you have something quick and easy, ping me on X. I'm [@Y0UNGSECURITY](https://twitter.com/Y0UNGSECURITY).
